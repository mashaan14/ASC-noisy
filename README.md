## 	Approximate spectral clustering density-based similarity for noisy datasets
This is an implementation for the following paper:
```
@article{ALSHAMMARI2019155,
	title = {Approximate spectral clustering density-based similarity for noisy datasets},
	journal = {Pattern Recognition Letters},
	volume = {128},
	pages = {155-161},
	year = {2019},
	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2019.08.020},
	author = {Mashaan Alshammari and Masahiro Takatsuka}
}
```

## How to use:

Run BATCH_Points.m which will execute the following:
1.	PRE_Points.m to load toy data, csv files are the groundtruth labels.
2.	RUN_Points.m to perform spectral clustering with CONN filtering.
3.	POST_Points.m to compute the accuracy of clustering
